# DK63 keyboard tray for Calisto 2 and a half 

This is an attempt to allow people to build new instances of the
[Calisto 2 and a Half](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6643913)
project on Thingiverse.  It's a wonderful project, but the 3 keyboards
used for the build are either no-longer avaiable, or are very expensive.

This project to adapt the DK63N keyboard tray to allow for the use 
of the DK63 in it's place, since it is still widely available (as
of March 2025).  This can probably be adapted to other keyboards as
well, though the basic design won't allow for keyboards much wider 
than the DK63 without fundamentally reworking the A & B parts.
